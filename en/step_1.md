## Install Rasperry Pi OS on your SD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager

Many vendors sell SD cards with a simple Rasperry Pi OS installer called NOOBS preinstalled but you can really easily install Rasperry Pi O yourself using a computer that has an SD card port or using an SD card reader.

Using the Raspberry Pi Imager is the easiest way to install Rasperry Pi O on your SD card.

### Using the Raspberry Pi Imager

All data stored on the SD card will be overwritten during formatting and lost permanently, so make sure that you back up the card or any files you want to keep before running the installer.

When you launch the installer, your operating system may try to block you from running it. For example, Windows may give the following message:

+ If you get this, click on `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

+ Insert your SD card into the computer or laptopâ€™s SD card slot.

+ In the Raspberry Pi Imager, select the OS that you want to install. The first option, Rasperry Pi O, is the recommended OS.
